* If you can't find a solution to your problem in FAQ, ask for help in Slack

## Overview

### Objective

Teach practical aspects of productionizing ML services â€” from training and experimenting to model deployment and monitoring.

### Target audience

Data scientists and ML engineers. Also software engineers and data engineers interested in learning about putting ML in production.

### Pre-requisites

* Python
* Docker
* Being comfortable with command line 
* Prior exposure to machine learning (at work or from other courses, e.g. from [ML Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp))
* Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)
